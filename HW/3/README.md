#### :white_circle: In the simulation problems, two topics are simulated: 
1. `Coded Modulation Systems`: For a given coded system, with QPSK modulation, while the channel response is known in the receiver and ML is used for decoding, the AWGN and fading channels' performance is demonstrated. Besides, the diversity order of this system is also determined. 
2. `Antenna Array`: The pattern of a specific antenna array is plotted in various cases, and the final SNR is reported. 
    1. Three signals with various SNR and AOA values arrive while the beamforming coefficient are chosen based on MRC coefficinets. 
    2. Four independent complex Gaussian signals with various SNR and AOA values arrive while the beamforming coefficient are chosen such that perfect null is provided in the direction of interfering signals. 
    3. Two signals with different SNR and AOA values arrive while the beamforming coefficient are chosen such that the SINR is maximized.
