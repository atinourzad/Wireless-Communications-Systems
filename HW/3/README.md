#### :white_circle: In the simulation problems, two topics are simulated: 
1. `Coded Modulation Systems`: For a given coded system, with QPSK modulation, while the channel response in known in the receiver and ML is used for decoding, the AWGN and fading channels' performance is demonstrated. Besides, the diversity order of this system is also determined. 
2. `Antenna Array`: For a specific antenna array, it's pattern is plotted in various cases.
