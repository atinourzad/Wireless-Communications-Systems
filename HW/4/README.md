#### :white_circle: In the simulation problem, a wireless communication system is concidered which uses 16-QAM with 4 different coding schemes. The coding scheme is chosen adaptively based on the CSI feedback that is received from RX. The best strategy of transmission, average data rate, and probability of using each coding scheme are found based on the desired BER and power value.
